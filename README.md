# LectureTalk

LectureTalk, a Sailjs application, is like a Elearning website where students can register courses (add,
remove courses) and view course details. Another feature of LectureTalk is that it
allows students to have a live group chatting when a lecture starts in real-time (i.e.
students receives messages immediately, students do not need to refresh browsers to
receive messages)
